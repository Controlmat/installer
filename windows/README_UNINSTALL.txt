The Spectrecoin uninstaller will perform the following tasks:
- Check if Spectrecoin is already running and shut it down
- Uninstall the Spectrecoin wallet software
- Remove Start-Menu entries

The blockchain data together with your wallet.dat file will NOT be removed!
Your wallet.dat file is the most important file, see %appdata%\Spectrecoin

Thx for using Spectrecoin!
