The Aliaswallet uninstaller will perform the following tasks:
- Check if Aliaswallet is already running and shut it down
- Uninstall the Aliaswallet wallet software
- Remove installation folder
- Remove Start-Menu entries

The blockchain data together with your wallet.dat file will NOT be removed!
Your wallet.dat file is the most important file, see %appdata%\Aliaswallet

Thx for using Aliaswallet!
