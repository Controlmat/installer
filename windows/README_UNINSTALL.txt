The Alias wallet uninstaller will perform the following tasks:
- Check if wallet is already running and shut it down
- Uninstall the wallet software
- Remove installation folder
- Remove Start menu entries

The blockchain data together with your wallet.dat file will NOT be removed!
Your wallet.dat file is the most important file, see %appdata%\Aliaswallet

Thx for using Alias wallet!
